<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    Hi! My name is Jevone Cyrille G. Abinal, and I’m 19 years old. I currently live in Masbate City, a place where I was both born and raised.
    Masbate holds a very special place in my heart. Being a Masbateño is more than just an identity for me—it’s a significant part of who I am.
    The unique culture, the warm and resilient people, and the everyday life in Masbate have all shaped my character and helped me develop the core
    values I carry today. From a young age, I was surrounded by a community that values hard work, kindness, and perseverance. These traits were 
    instilled in me early on and continue to guide me in everything I do.
 <h1>Life in Masbate: Challenges and Strength</h1>
 <p>Growing up in Masbate came with its fair share of challenges. Life here isn’t always easy, but those difficulties have strengthened my resolve and determination to succeed.
    I’ve learned that family is everything, and even when the path ahead seems tough, perseverance and dedication are key to achieving one’s dreams.
    These values are my foundation. Whenever I face obstacles or moments of doubt, I remind myself that giving up is never an option. Every struggle I face now is just another stepping
    stone toward building a better future for myself and my loved ones.</p>
 <h1>Why I Chose Information Technology (IT)</h1>
 <p>One of my biggest goals right now is to graduate with a degree in Information Technology. This decision isn’t just based on interest—it's deeply connected to my personal
    goals and family aspirations. I chose IT because it opens up a world of opportunities, both here and abroad. The ever-evolving nature of technology excites me,
    and I see it as a field where I can grow continuously and contribute meaningfully.
    More importantly, my dream is to support and eventually reunite with my family in Singapore, where they are currently working. I believe that a career in IT can provide the
    stability and opportunities I need to make that dream a reality. Knowing that my education could lead to a better life for all of us fuels my motivation every day.</p>
    <h1>Conclusion: Looking Ahead with Purpose</h1>
<p>At 19, I know my journey is only just beginning. I don’t have all the answers yet, and I’m still figuring out who I am and what life has in store. But what I do know is that patience, 
    determination, and a strong connection to my roots will guide me forward. At 19, I know my journey is only just beginning. I don’t have all the answers yet, and I’m still figuring out
