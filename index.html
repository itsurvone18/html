<hr>
<head><p> Hi! My name is Jevone Cyrille G. Abinal, I’m 19 years old, and I live in Masbate City. I was born and raised here, and I can proudly say that being a Masbateño is a big part of who I am. The culture, the people, and the life here shaped my character and taught me the values I carry today.

Growing up in Masbate wasn’t always easy, but it made me strong and determined. I learned how important family, perseverance, and hard work are in reaching my dreams. That’s why I always remind myself to keep going no matter the challenges I face.

Right now, one of my biggest goals is to graduate in Information Technology. I want to achieve this not only for myself but also so I can be with my family in Singapore and work with them. It motivates me every day to keep studying and moving forward.

At 19, I know my journey is just beginning. I may not have figured everything out yet, but I’m confident that with patience and determination, I’ll reach the life I’m dreaming of. Being a Masbateño makes me proud because it reminds me that even from a small city, I can dream big and achieve great things.

This is my story so far, and I’m excited to see where life will take me next. </p></head>
